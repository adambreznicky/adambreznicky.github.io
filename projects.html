    <p>
      Texas is no stranger to flood. With its diverse geography and extensive,
      hurricane-prone coastline, the state frequently leads the nation not only
      in structural damage but also in loss of lives related to flooding events.<br>
      As part of the developer team at TNRIS, our crew inherited the original concept
      of the Flood Information Viewer and fed it adrenaline for 6 months until it
      became a well-oiled machine of public safety. This application utilizes a
      backend Python engine which utilizes Celery tasks to scrape the NOAA/NWS
      flood gage database, processes the data, and dumps it into a Carto hosted
      Postgres database in an frontend interpretable format. The backend also connects
      with AWS SNS services to alert users via SMS text messages when flood gages
      are at dangerous levels. Even further, the backend engine performs routine
      self-maintenance tasks to moderate the various database tables.<br>
      The application frontend is a Node JS &amp; Webpack compiled site hosted
      within an AWS S3 bucket and dispersed via AWS Cloudfront technology for
      performance and certification. The UI is built with React JS and styled with
      Material Design Lite. The Flood Information Viewer's mapping functionality
      is constructed with Leaflet and pulling data from Carto and the Aeri's Weather
      API.<br>
      This application uses AWS Cognito to handle user accounts and sercurity for
      the flood gage status subscription service.

      Creating and maintaining an asset database is a no small feat for any major
      organization or government. While employed at the Texas Department of
      Transportation, reporting assests was a monumental priority and it was evident
      collusion tools could help get the job done. This application was designed to
      empower local subject matter experts with GIS capabilities by providing a
      spatial environment for the review and markup of their current geospatial road
      inventory asset data on file with the State. With capabilites to edit,
      download, and upload data, this is a revolution of the traditional paper
      methods used for routine update projects.<br>
      This is a static, single page web application heavily utilizing ESRI tools.
      The web map and data editing tools are built from the ESRI JS API. All data
      is hosted from ESRI REST Services within ArcGIS Online. REST Service data is
      downloadable while formatted Shapefiles can also be uploaded through the
      application, both via custom Python Geoprocessing Tools published to ArcServer.<br>
      Styling and CSS from Bootstrap.

      The Texas Natural Resources Information System's Official Website: tnris.org<br>
      Inherited by the current TNRIS Developer Team, the official TNRIS website
      is the central hub for finding and acquiring GIS data within the State of
      Texas. TNRIS collects and publicly provides community news, geospatial data,
      LiDAR, &amp; historical aerial imagery while also assuming the role of
      community leader organizing conferences, meetings, and cost share initiatives.<br>
      This is a static website compiled via Gulp tasks &amp; Webpack assembling
      various templates with their associated code. The Data Catalog functionality
      is a frontend search and sortable listing of the data TNRIS provides. The
      Data Download page is an independent Angular JS application whose API
      provides TNRIS.org users the capability to query their desired datasets
      and access it for download from AWS S3 storage. This website's contact forms
      are also channeled through a separate application to handle and deliver the forms.

      A transformative application suite for non-technical users to perform
      routine their field workflow in a digital record environment using geolocation
      and smart mobile devices. This application suite retires old paper methods as
      information is instantly logged to REST services complete with location,
      attribution, and attachments. It also permits supervisors to query, navigate,
      monitor, map, and update data directly in the field using their smart mobile device.<br>
      The suite consists of four single page, static applications; one for each:<br>
        &emsp;- Collecting data in the field of work to be done (Road Runner)<br>
        &emsp;- Work/Data reviewed with status logging from the field (Coyote)<br>
        &emsp;- Work Completed progress mapping (Web Map)<br>
        &emsp;- Work Status Summarization from the office (Report)<br>
      The applications utilize the ESRI JS API for mapping and display of the data.
      The field applications use HTML5 Geolocation and are designed for use from
      common smart mobile devices. They communicate with data hosted via REST Services
      within ArcGIS Online to view, edit, and add information. The Road Runner
      data collector empowers users to take pictures with their smart devices and
      attribute them as assests to the data collected.<br>
      The office applications query and analyze the REST Services while the Web
      Map visually displays the spatial data and permits users to edit from the
      office parallel to the field work.<br>
      All applications leverage Bootstrap and Dojo for styling.

    <p>
      This website is an integral part of the 2017 State Water Plan that lets
      water users statewide take an up-close look at data in the 2017 State
      Water Plan and how water needs change over time. The user-friendly website,
      which is also easily viewed on most mobile devices, now shows:<br>
           - projected water demands,<br>
           - existing water supplies,<br>
           - the relative severity and projected water needs (potential shortages),<br>
           - the water management strategies recommended to address potential shortages, and<br>
           - recommended capital projects and their sponsors.<br>
      over the next 50 years in geographical and tabular forms. Note that all
      county-based water user group categories are mapped to the same location
      at the center of each county.
