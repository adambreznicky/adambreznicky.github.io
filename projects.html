    </h4>
    <p>
      LS4 is a monster, raster processing engine. A chained lambda function engine,
      LS4 is a multi-step series of lambda functions for processing aerial imagery
      to automatically and programmatically make it available to the public as a WMS Mapserver
      service as well as for download as georeferenced or original scanned images. The engine
      monitors an AWS s3 bucket for original and georeferenced scans of historical
      aerial imagery (a TNRIS archive specialty). Upon upload, the engine detects
      spatial reference, reprojects (when necessary), uses GDAL to process from
      georeferenced tifs to COGS, creates spatial footprints, and creates WMS services
      for both the images and footprints. TNRIS is a historical archive of over a million
      historical aerial photographs and this engine empowers non-programmers to
      concentrate on simply scanning and georeferencing each photo in the archive
      while their work automatically processes the fruits of their labor and adds their
      digitized data to the publically available catalog of data products TNRIS stands to
      exist for.

    <p>
      Texas is no stranger to flood. With its diverse geography and extensive,
      hurricane-prone coastline, the state frequently leads the nation not only
      in structural damage but also in loss of lives related to flooding events.<br>
      As part of the developer team at TNRIS, our crew inherited the original concept
      of the Flood Information Viewer and fed it adrenaline for 6 months until it
      became a well-oiled machine of public safety. This application utilizes a
      backend Python engine which utilizes Celery tasks to scrape the NOAA/NWS
      flood gage database, processes the data, and dumps it into a Carto hosted
      Postgres database in an frontend interpretable format. The backend also connects
      with AWS SNS services to alert users via SMS text messages when flood gages
      are at dangerous levels. Even further, the backend engine performs routine
      self-maintenance tasks to moderate the various database tables.<br>
      The application frontend is a Node JS &amp; Webpack compiled site hosted
      within an AWS S3 bucket and dispersed via AWS Cloudfront technology for
      performance and certification.The javascript is written in the latest version
      ES6 and converted to ES5 during compilation via Babel.<br>
      The UI is built with React JS modeled from
      a Redux state store and styled with Material Design Lite. The Flood
      Information Viewer's mapping functionality is constructed with Leaflet and
      pulling data from Carto and the Aeri's Weather API.<br>
      This application uses AWS Cognito to handle user accounts and sercurity for
      the flood gage status subscription service.

      Creating and maintaining an asset database is a no small feat for any major
      organization or government. While employed at the Texas Department of
      Transportation, reporting assests was a monumental priority and it was evident
      collusion tools could help get the job done. This application was designed to
      empower local subject matter experts with GIS capabilities by providing a
      spatial environment for the review and markup of their current geospatial road
      inventory asset data on file with the State. With capabilites to edit,
      download, and upload data, this is a revolution of the traditional paper
      methods used for routine update projects.<br>
      This is a static, single page web application heavily utilizing ESRI tools.
      The web map and data editing tools are built from the ESRI JS API. All data
      is hosted from ESRI REST Services within ArcGIS Online. REST Service data is
      downloadable while formatted Shapefiles can also be uploaded through the
      application, both via custom Python Geoprocessing Tools published to ArcServer.<br>

      is the central hub for finding and acquiring GIS data within the State of
      Texas. TNRIS collects and publicly provides community news, geospatial data,
      LiDAR, &amp; historical aerial imagery while also assuming the role of
      community leader organizing conferences, meetings, and cost share initiatives.<br>
      This is a static website compiled via Gulp tasks &amp; Webpack assembling
      various templates with their associated code. The Data Catalog functionality
      is a frontend search and sortable listing of the data TNRIS provides. The
      Data Download page is an independent Angular JS application run within a Docker
      container whose API provides TNRIS.org users the capability to query their
      desired datasets and access it for download from AWS S3 storage. This
      website's contact forms are also channeled through a separate Docker containerized
      application to handle and deliver the forms.

      An organizational and consolidational project, the TNRIS Data Holodeck is the result
      of a sincere developer effort to cleanup internal infrastructure and workflows in
      order to strategize a reliable, long term workflow for managing internal data products
      and their availablility to the public. Creating the Holodeck required scripting Python
      functions to mine, scrape, standardize, and organize legacy metadata from Markdown files and ETL
      the information into a PostgreSQL RDS database. Managed by a Django project with an Amazon RDS
      PostgreSQL database, the Holodeck facilitates and empowers TNRIS employees to
      directly manage the catalog of data content, which the organization provides to
      the public, without programming knowledge. A clean home
      makes for a happy home and this project is the exemplary of an organized home with
      easy-to-use tools which make said organization inexcusable.
      More importantly, the Data Holodeck creates RESTful API access to the catalog of data
      TNRIS has to offer. The publically open API is used by the ReactJS frontend itself to allow users
      to search, query, and sort the database of datasets in the most efficient ways
      possible. The application truly optimizes the purpose of the TNRIS organization:
      provide free data which is discoverable and acquirable by the most fluvial of mechanisms.

      A transformative application suite for non-technical users to perform
      routine their field workflow in a digital record environment using geolocation
      and smart mobile devices. This application suite retires old paper methods as
      information is instantly logged to REST services complete with location,
      attribution, and attachments. It also permits supervisors to query, navigate,
      monitor, map, and update data directly in the field using their smart mobile device.<br>
      The suite consists of four single page, static applications; one for each:<br>
        &emsp;- Collecting data in the field of work to be done (Road Runner)<br>
        &emsp;- Work/Data reviewed with status logging from the field (Coyote)<br>
        &emsp;- Work Completed progress mapping (Web Map)<br>
        &emsp;- Work Status Summarization from the office (Report)<br>
      The applications utilize the ESRI JS API for mapping and display of the data.
      The field applications use HTML5 Geolocation and are designed for use from
      common smart mobile devices. They communicate with data hosted via REST Services
      within ArcGIS Online to view, edit, and add information. The Road Runner
      data collector empowers users to take pictures with their smart devices and
      attribute them as assests to the data collected.<br>
      The office applications query and analyze the REST Services while the Web
      Map visually displays the spatial data and permits users to edit from the
      office parallel to the field work.<br>
      All applications leverage Bootstrap and Dojo for styling.

      This website is an integral part of the 2017 Texas State Water Plan that lets
      water users statewide take an up-close look at data in the 2017 Texas State
      Water Plan and how water needs change over time. The user-friendly website,
      which is also easily viewed on most mobile devices, now shows:<br>
        &emsp;- projected water demands,<br>
        &emsp;- existing water supplies,<br>
        &emsp;- the relative severity and projected water needs (potential shortages),<br>
        &emsp;- the water management strategies recommended to address potential shortages, and<br>
        &emsp;- recommended capital projects and their sponsors.<br>
      over the next 50 years in geographical and tabular forms.<br>
      This application displays numerous representations of the Texas Water Plan
      data through various charts, maps, and statistics. The Docker containerized
      application holds the data within a localized SQLite3 database with access
      via a publically accessible JS API. The frontend is assembled with React JS
      modeling out of a Flux state store. A Hapi server manages the routing for this

    <p>
      A simple but exceptionally powerful
      application used for a time sensitive G.E.T. field data collection effort
      to satisfy a high priority data request. This application empowered
      non-technical users the ability to participate in data collection at a
      record pace using only their smart mobile devices.<br>
      <img src="adambreznicky.github.io/static/images/getapp1.png" class="pull-left" style="max-width:50%;" alt/>
      This is was an extremely high stakes and high speed project. Upon awareness
      of safety sensitive guardrail end treatments existing on Texas Highways, the
      state put upon the highest priority to locate, count, and geospatially catalog
      all GET assets within the state as fast as possible. We took advantage of
      our field maintenance personnel across the state with their mobile devices
      by developing this application which attributed GET types to geolocated
      positions while users drove the highways as regular driving speeds.<br>
      The application is an extremely simple, single page, static HTML interface
      (cached for non-cell service use) utilizing local storage for data collection
      and ArcGIS REST Services for data upload and collection. The compiled dataset
      was then easily mapped and statistically analyzed.<br>
      This project was a monumental achievement with a complete duration of
      less than two months including cause, concept, design, implementation, data
      collection, and analysis. Over 130,000 data points were collected in approximately
      three weeks.
