<h2>My Story</h2>
<h8 class="boundInDown animated"><i class="italic">TL;DR I kind of just fell into it.</i></h8>
<p class="boundInDown animated">
  Born and raised in the small, rural town of Hereford, Maryland, I attended
  Salisbury University to receive my undergraduate degree. I studied Geography
  there, concentrating on the physical sciences like geomorphology and coastal
  processes. After graduating, reality hit that we now live in a technical
  world and those GIS classes I was required to take might be worth something.<br>
  <img src="/adambreznicky.github.io/static/images/dune.jpg" class="pull-right gap-left bounceInLeft animated" alt/>
  I spent a few years at various engineering firms fulfilling analyst roles
  managing databases, making maps, processing geospatial data, etc. Throughout
  these positions I was forced to independently problem solve and all too commonly
  solutions seemed quickly and readily available by utlizing Python but I
  had no mentor or education as to how to use Python (or what it really was).<br>
  I then took on the challenge to self educate myself if not only to make my
  day-to-day tasks easier. It was a conceptually difficult road until soon
  after I started when I took an Analyst position with the Texas Department of
  Transportation. I joined a team of fellow Analysts which had programming
  experience and was quickly mentored to fill in the conceptual gaps I was
  missing. It was off to the races... Coding seemed to come quite naturally
  after that initial hump; It was full of discovery. It was powerful and full
  of endless possibilities. Most of all, it was so much fun!<br>
  <img src="/adambreznicky.github.io/static/images/bored.jpg" class="pull-left gap-right bounceInRight animated" alt/>
  The job I was hired for was a mundane, daily routine of performing the same
  tasks over and over again. I utilized Python to program the entire responsibilities
  of the position by the click of a button. Suddenly I found myself showing up
  to work and having nothing to do, almost ever. So I filled my time by continuing
  to code. I programmed various other routine tasks for the others on my team. I
  created tools and extensions for their GIS programs to speed up their daily work
  also.<br>
  My programming experience changed chapters at this time as I began playing with
  Javascript. Being of the geospatial data field, I fell in love when HTML5
  introduced geolocation funcitonality. It was ridiculously easy to use and
  unimaginably powerful given the smartphone era where all users already own
  the hardware necessary to participate. It started with extremely simple, single
  page static web applications which provided users working out in the field
  with a form to fill out. Pull their geolocation latitude and longitude, attribute
  it with the form information, upload it to a Postgres database, and Voil√†!--
  field collected GIS data immediately available for analysts in the office to
  immediately utilize before the field crews are even done drinking their morning
  coffee. With inspiration from my leadership, I took this concept and expanded it
  to numerous projects and data collection workflows. Most notably the design,
  construction, and implementation of a application suite which absolved a legacy
  paper workflow in which labor field maintenance employees with minimal
  technical comprehension could now spatially track, complete, and plan their
  daily work assignments.<br>

  The waves were steadily rolling in as I explored all the new opportunities
  available in the web application world. ArcGIS Online was my introduction to
  cloud infrastructure and REST services. It is an out-of-the-box, user friendly
  REST service and web mapping system created by ESRI for GIS professionals. It
  takes the technical out of the cloud world and makes it easy for analysts to
  worry about analyzing rather than the <i class="italic">technical stuff</i>... but of course,
  the <i class="italic">technical stuff</i> was the interesting part to me.<br>
  I used ArcGIS Online as it was the only service available to me within the
  Department's network. I utilized REST services and ESRI's web API's to begin
  hosting data. Within the cloud and services paradigm, I was able to develop
  applications for displaying the current data inventory and provide an editing
  environment for clients to review, interact with, and edit the data (even upload
  their own for adding to our system).<br>

  As one could imagine, my professional concentration, desires, and experience
  had elevated past an analyst titled position about this time. The perfect
  alignment of timing and luck occured to migrate me into an official web
  developer position for the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS).
  Joining the TNRIS Developer team accelerated my cloud, networking, programming,
  database, and general development education at an exponential rate. Single page,
  static web applications were immediately rudimentary as I was awarded the freedom
  to build an entire cloud infrastructure within Amazon Web Services. Web
  Application development evolved to incorporate server engines such as Flask
  and Node JS and became containerized with Docker. User Interfaces grew the
  power of injection right before my eyes through React and Angular. Database
  systems became readily available as servers are spun up at the click of a
  mouse. The whole complex machine-- it's architecture and every component--
  is now code networked and managed within VPC's through Terraform. And still
  there seems to be no end in sight to what can be done.<br>
  This field of web development and cloud computing is still so young. I find
  an endless amount of pleasure and reward from coding, networking, and working
  with data. Not a day goes by I don't recognize how lucky I am to have found
  such a fulfilling field to work in.<br>
</p>
<p>
  And to think, I kind of just fell into it.
