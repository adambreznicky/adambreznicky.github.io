<h2>My Story</h2>
<h6><small><i class="italic">So how did I get here...?</i></small><h6>
<p>
  Born and raised in the small, rural town of Hereford, Maryland, I attended
  Salisbury University to receive my undergraduate degree. I studied Geography
  there, concentrating on the physical sciences like geomorphology and coastal
  processes. After graduating, reality hit that we now live in a technical
  world and those GIS classes I was required to take might be worth something.<br>
  I spent a few years at various engineering firms fulfilling analyst roles
  managing databases, making maps, processing geospatial data, etc. Throughout
  these positions I was forced to independently problem solve and all too commonly
  solutions seemed quickly and readily available by utlizing Python but I
  had no mentor or education as to how to use Python (or what it really was).<br>
  I then took on the challenge to self educate myself if not only to make my
  day-to-day tasks easier. It was a conceptually difficult road until soon
  after I started when I took an Analyst position with the Texas Department of
  Transportation. I joined a team of fellow Analysts which had programming
  experience and was quickly mentored to fill in the conceptual gaps I was
  missing. It was off to the races... Coding seemed to come quite naturally
  after that initial hump; It was full of discovery. It was powerful and full
  of endless possibilities. Most of all, it was so much fun!<br>
  The job I was hired for was a mundane, daily routine of performing the same
  tasks over and over again. I utilized Python to program the entire responsibilities
  of the position by the click of a button. Suddenly I found myself showing up
  to work and having nothing to do, almost ever. So I continued to code by
  programming various other tasks
